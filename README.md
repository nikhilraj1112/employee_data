# employee_data
This project predicts employee salaries (&lt;= or >$50K) using a RandomForest model, achieving 85.61% accuracy. It cleans data, encodes categories, trains the model, and saves results like a confusion matrix, model, and encoders. It's a system that learns from employee characteristics to make salary bracket guesses.
